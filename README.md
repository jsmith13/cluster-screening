## Objectives
- Identify the compound series with relatively high odds of translation from hit to lead present in a phenotypic screen for inhibitors of *M. tuberculosis*.

## Dataset
- Phenotypic screening data collected from the PubChem bioassay repository (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/449764).
- Molecular descriptors calculated using KNIME-CDK.

## Contents 
- data  
A folder containing the raw and augmented datasets in csv format.

- cluster_centroids.pptx  
A Powerpoint drawing of the centroid structures for each prioritized cluster.

- clusters.ipynb  
Clustering, filtering, and visualization of the dataset.
